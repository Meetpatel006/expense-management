# Features Overview

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Level Approval Workflows ✅

The system supports complex approval hierarchies with multiple levels:

```
Expense → Manager → Director → VP/CFO → Approved
```

- Each level can have different approver roles
- Configurable number of required approvers per level
- Automatic progression through levels
- Rejection at any level stops the workflow immediately

**Example:**
```typescript
// $8000 expense requires 3 levels
{
  approvalLevels: [
    { level: 1, approverRoles: ['MANAGER'], requiredApprovers: 1 },
    { level: 2, approverRoles: ['DIRECTOR'], requiredApprovers: 1 },
    { level: 3, approverRoles: ['VP', 'CFO'], requiredApprovers: 1 }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Threshold-Based Rules ✅

Define approval requirements based on expense amounts:

| Amount Range | Approval Levels |
|-------------|----------------|
| < $100 | Manager only |
| $100 - $1,000 | Manager |
| $1,000 - $5,000 | Manager → Director |
| ≥ $5,000 | Manager → Director → VP/CFO |

**Example:**
```typescript
{
  conditions: [
    { type: 'AMOUNT', operator: 'GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL', value: 5000 }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Flexible Rule Configuration ✅

Create custom rules with multiple conditions:

**Supported Condition Types:**
- **Amount**: `AMOUNT` - Based on expense value
- **Category**: `CATEGORY` - Based on expense type (Travel, Meals, etc.)
- **Department**: `DEPARTMENT` - Based on employee's department
- **Employee Level**: `EMPLOYEE_LEVEL` - Based on employee's seniority

**Supported Operators:**
- `EQUALS` - Exact match
- `GREATER_THAN` - Value is greater
- `LESS_THAN` - Value is less
- `GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL` - Value is greater or equal
- `LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL` - Value is less or equal
- `IN` - Value in a list

**Example:**
```typescript
{
  conditions: [
    { type: 'CATEGORY', operator: 'EQUALS', value: 'TRAVEL' },
    { type: 'AMOUNT', operator: 'GREATER_THAN', value: 500 }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Rule Priority System ✅

Higher priority rules are evaluated first:

```typescript
// High priority exception rule
{ id: 'vip-rule', priority: 100, ... }

// Standard rules
{ id: 'standard-rule', priority: 10, ... }

// Low priority catch-all
{ id: 'default-rule', priority: 1, ... }
```

### 5. Role-Based Authorization ✅

Different approver roles at each level:

**Built-in Roles:**
- `MANAGER` - First-level approver
- `DIRECTOR` - Second-level approver
- `VP` - Executive approver
- `CFO` - Finance approver
- `TRAVEL_COORDINATOR` - Special travel approver
- `HR_DIRECTOR` - HR-specific approver
- Custom roles can be added

**Example:**
```typescript
// Check if user can approve
const canApprove = approvalFlowService.canApprove(
  flowId,
  'MANAGER',
  'mgr-001'
);
```

### 6. Complete Approval History ✅

Track every approval action:

```typescript
{
  approvalHistory: [
    {
      approverId: 'mgr-001',
      approverName: 'Sarah Manager',
      approverLevel: 1,
      action: 'APPROVED',
      timestamp: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z',
      comments: 'Approved - within budget'
    }
  ]
}
```

### 7. Transparent Status Tracking ✅

Real-time visibility into approval status:

```typescript
const summary = approvalFlowService.getApprovalSummary(flowId);
// Returns:
{
  currentLevel: 2,
  totalLevels: 3,
  status: 'PENDING',
  steps: [
    { level: 1, roles: ['MANAGER'], required: 1, approved: 1, status: 'APPROVED' },
    { level: 2, roles: ['DIRECTOR'], required: 1, approved: 0, status: 'PENDING' },
    { level: 3, roles: ['VP', 'CFO'], required: 1, approved: 0, status: 'PENDING' }
  ]
}
```

### 8. Expense Categories ✅

Pre-defined categories for expense classification:

- **TRAVEL** - Flights, hotels, transportation
- **MEALS** - Client dinners, team lunches
- **OFFICE_SUPPLIES** - Stationery, supplies
- **EQUIPMENT** - Computers, monitors, phones
- **TRAINING** - Courses, certifications, conferences
- **OTHER** - Miscellaneous expenses

### 9. Expense Lifecycle Management ✅

Complete state machine for expenses:

```
DRAFT → PENDING → APPROVED
                → REJECTED
                → CANCELLED
```

**State Transitions:**
- `DRAFT` → `PENDING`: Submit for approval
- `PENDING` → `APPROVED`: All levels approved
- `PENDING` → `REJECTED`: Any level rejects
- `DRAFT/PENDING` → `CANCELLED`: Employee cancels

### 10. Validation & Error Prevention ✅

Built-in validations:

- ✅ Prevent unauthorized approvals
- ✅ Prevent duplicate approvals from same user
- ✅ Prevent approvals on completed flows
- ✅ Validate approver role for current level
- ✅ Validate expense status transitions

### 11. Query & Reporting ✅

Multiple ways to retrieve expense data:

```typescript
// Get all expenses for an employee
const expenses = expenseService.getExpensesByEmployee('emp-001');

// Get pending approvals for a role
const pending = expenseService.getPendingExpensesForApprover('MANAGER');

// Get specific expense details
const expense = expenseService.getExpense('exp-123');

// Get approval flow details
const flow = approvalFlowService.getFlowByExpenseId('exp-123');
```

### 12. Special Category Rules ✅

Category-specific approval flows:

**Example: Travel Expenses**
```typescript
{
  name: 'Travel Expenses Special Rule',
  conditions: [
    { type: 'CATEGORY', operator: 'EQUALS', value: 'TRAVEL' },
    { type: 'AMOUNT', operator: 'GREATER_THAN', value: 500 }
  ],
  approvalLevels: [
    { level: 1, approverRoles: ['MANAGER'], requiredApprovers: 1 },
    { level: 2, approverRoles: ['TRAVEL_COORDINATOR'], requiredApprovers: 1 }
  ]
}
```

### 13. Type Safety ✅

Full TypeScript support with type definitions:

```typescript
interface Expense {
  id: string;
  employeeId: string;
  amount: number;
  status: ExpenseStatus;
  // ... full type definitions
}
```

### 14. Comprehensive Testing ✅
